write a program to calculate perimeter of the circle with radius 10.2
Pi = 3.14
Radius = 10.2
Perimeter = float (2 * Pi * Radius)
print ("Perimeter of the circle is "Perimeter)

write a program to calculate area of circle with radius (float) (collect using input function)
Pi = 3.14
Radius = float (input ("Please enter the radius: "))
Area = Pi * Radius**2
print ("Area of circle is ",Area)

write a program to calculate perimeter of the cricle with radius (float) (collect it through input function)
Pi = 3.14
Radius = float (input ("Please enter the radius: "))
Perimeter = 2 * Pi * Radius
print (f"Perimeter of the cricle is {Perimeter}")

Collect radius and height from user,
calculate Area of cone (area of cone = 0.33 * pi * r * r * h) (int)

radius = float (input ("Enter the radius value: "))
height = float (input ("Enter the height value: "))

Area_of_cone = float (0.33 * 3.14 * (radius**2) * height)

print ("Area of the cone is : ", Area_of_cone)
